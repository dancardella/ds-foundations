### <a name="section-a"></a>1. Study Options

#### Review Option
###### (1 - 2 hours)

Here is a review sheet about [Statistics from MIT](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ds-foundations/resources/stats_handout.pdf) and one about [Probability from William Chen](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ds-foundations/resources/prob_handout.pdf).

*Note: We mostly focus on statistical learning methods in our curriculum*

#### Comprehensive Option
###### (5 - 12 hours)

[Statistics and Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) from Khan Academy. The material is free and self-paced.

#### Reference Option

[Statistics 3rd Edition Textbook](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os). The textbook is free and self-paced. There are several practice problems and accompanying data sets to dig into.

### <a name="section-b"></a>2. Applied Python

To implement statistics in Python, we will be utilizing `numpy` and the `SciPy` packages. `SciPy` has a special submodule called `scipy.stats` that has several intermediate to advanced numerical implementations of statistics and probability.

Work your way through these 3 presentations and code along in Python when applicable:

1. [Statistical Modeling](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ds-foundations/resources/slides-stat-modelling.pdf)
2. [Correlations](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ds-foundations/resources/slides-correlations.pdf)
3. *Optional* - [Monte Carlo Analysis](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ds-foundations/resources/slides-monte-carlo.pdf)
